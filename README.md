# The-Amplifier---Positive-Feedback-Loop-Game
An interactive mobile game built in React Native/Expo where players manage a central Orb’s Echo Strength through tapping. The game teaches positive feedback loops by rewarding controlled amplification, warning against overload, and illustrating system decay, using dynamic visuals and responsive audio cues to enhance engagement.
